# Homework: variables, data types, and atomic vectors
# ===================================================

# Goal: use atomic vectors

# clear workspace
rm(list = ls())

# read numeric vectors person, height, and weight
load("hw02.RData")

# 1. count how many subjects you have and save it
number_of_subjects <- length(person)
save(number_of_subjects, file = "results.RData")

# 2. calculate median weight and save it
med_weight <- median(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
save(number_of_subjects, med_weight, file = "results.RData")

# 3. for each person, calculate BMI and round it to tenths
bmi <- round(weight / ((height/100)^2), digits = 1)
save(number_of_subjects, med_weight, bmi, file = "results.RData")

# 4. count obese subjects
number_of_obese <- length(bmi[bmi>=30])
save(number_of_subjects, med_weight, bmi, number_of_obese, file = "results.RData")

# 5. create a vector with the names of the obese subjects
obese_subjects <- person[bmi>=30]
save(number_of_subjects, med_weight, bmi, number_of_obese, obese_subjects,
     file = "results.RData")
